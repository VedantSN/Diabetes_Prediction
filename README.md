# ðŸ©º Diabetes Prediction Web App using SVM

This is a simple and interactive **Streamlit** web application for predicting whether a person is diabetic or not based on diagnostic measurements. The model is trained using the **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** algorithm with a **linear kernel**, and evaluated using a well-known dataset: `diabetes.csv`.
